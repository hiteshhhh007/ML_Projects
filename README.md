#Movie Recommender System

This is a movie recommender system which was developed using ML and was deployed to web using Streamlit application. Basically, it recommends similar movies based on the movie name which you give. This is done with the help of cosine similarity alogrithm. The Movie and credit dataset was taken from Kaggle.
The credit dataset has not been uploaded as it was of 200mb, hence that needs to be downloaded seperately. The attatched Jupyter Notebook contains the main code after all the preprocessing of data. In order to run this application in your local macine, just clone this repository and make sure to download the credits.csv and credits.pkl (Code is in the .ipynb) before running and you are good to go, assuming you have necessary libraries installed in your .py environment.

Few Screenshots has been attached for your reference on how the final application looks like after it has been deployed to web.
